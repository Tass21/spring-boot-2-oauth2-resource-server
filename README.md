# Spring Boot 2 Oauth2 resource server example

This is a bare-bones Spring Boot 2 Oauth2 resource server with an authorization server.

## Running

Here's a way to run it with docker (highly recommended for developing/testing).
If you wish to run it against your native environment, then just change the `application.properties` file.

Docker way:
1. Install docker
2. Run the docker container in the root of the project `docker-compose up`
3. Create a new terminal tab and cd into `bash_scripts` folder, run `./create-tables-add-data.sh`
4. Run the java project from `Application.java` main method

Server should now be up and running.

## Test API with Postman

1. Install postman
2. Import postman collection from the `project.postman_collection.json` file
3. Run the `/oauth/token` POST request and get a access_token.
4. Change the token value to the access_token in the other requests and all should be working.

## Password encryption

Spring Security 5 drastically changed the way they store passwords,
this project stores all passwords and client_details in BCrypt encryption.

And I think that's great!
